These bills contradict the unanimous consent of the medical profession — including the recommendations of the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics — that transgender people are a natural, normal part of the human experience and that gender-affirming medical care is the correct, appropriate, and responsible treatment for transgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive patients of all ages.%0D%0A%0D%0AA wide body of research has consistently shown that access to gender-affirming care saves lives, including specifically for trans youth. A 2022 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that access to gender-affirming care reduced suicidality in trans youth by 73%, while an analysis of 56 studies conducted by researchers at Cornell found that 93 percent of the studies found positive effects from gender transition — reflecting a “robust international consensus that gender transition improves the overall well-being of transgender individuals.” Notably, even a report commissioned by Utah lawmakers attempting to find supporting evidence to ban gender-affirming care for trans youth concluded that gender-affirming care is safe, well-researched, and leads to improved health outcomes for trans youth.%0D%0A%0D%0ASimply put, this proposed anti-trans legislation is not grounded in medical reality or the foundational principles that all people — including the transgender citizens of this nation — deserve life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

This is deeply concerning for all the reasons laid out above, as well as for two additional reasons: 1) this is an attempt to sidestep the authority of congress, including both of you as senators, to appropriate funds, and 2) because federal law explicitly prohibits HHS from controlling the practice of medicine.%0D%0A%0D%0AAllowing HHS to implement this disastrous rule change will kill innocent transgender citizens of this county all while eroding the constitutionally prescribed powers of congress and violating federal law.
